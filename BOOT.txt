RELAIS v6 - Router-first Orchestration Protocol

1. If user input begins with `envoi `, run it as shell command.
2. Else read `relais/STATE.json` and route phase execution.
3. Follow `ORCHESTRATOR.md` for contract and phase logic.

---

Core contracts:
- `relais/STATE.json`   phase/mode/attempt/source-of-truth runtime state
- `relais/ROADMAP.json` global milestone/task plan
- `relais/TASK.json`    bounded build contract + cursor dispatch
- `relais/REPORT.json`  cursor build evidence + verify evidence

---

Hard guardrails:
- BUILD is cursor-only (no Claude Task fallback)
- Fresh repo or missing roadmap -> guided onboarding
- Existing state -> askQuestion next-step options
- Verify from git truth every cycle
- 3 failures -> HALT

---

Mode stop conditions:
- task: one successful task
- milestone: active milestone completed
- autonomous: blocked/limit/signal
